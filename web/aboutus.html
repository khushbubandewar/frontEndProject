            The cultural center of Asia Minor, Pergamon boasted a vast library of 200,000 scrolls, a spectacular 10,000-seat theater, and a monumental Great Altar decorated with sculptures of the Olympian gods defeating the Giants. People came from all around the Mediterranean seeking cures at the famous Temple of Asclepius, god of medicine.
            A personal library is a reflection of who you are and who you want to be, of what you value and what you desire, of how much you know and how much more you'd like to know.
            One of the reasons that I take such joy in being a trustee of the Chhindwara Public Library is the love of reading that I found as a child in the Saturday morning library events for preschoolers and first and second graders as I was growing up in Chhindwara, India.
            Perhaps no place in any community is so totally democratic as the town library. The only entrance requirement is interest.The library was the place I went to find out what there was to know. It was absolutely essential.
            The greatest part of a writer's time is spent in reading in order to write. A man will turn over half a library to make a book.
